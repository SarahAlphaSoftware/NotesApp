# About NotesApp

A 'Notes' application was originally released in May, 2013. A number of changes have occurred in Alpha Anywhere over the years, leading to better ways to build this app. This project is an updated version of the 'Notes' application, designed to use newer concepts, such as ControlBars.

## Adding to a Project

2. Add the components (notes_simplified.a5wcmp and notesApp.a5wcmp) to a new or existing project
3. Create a connection string that connects to the notes.mdb Access database called "notes"
